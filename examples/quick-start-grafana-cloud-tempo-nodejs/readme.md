# Quick Start - Node.js app with Tempo, OpenTelemetry and Qualitytrace

> [Read the detailed recipe for setting up Tempo with Tractest in our documentation.](https://docs.quality-trace.io/examples-tutorials/recipes/running-quality-trace-with-tempo)

This is a simple quick start on how to configure a Node.js app to use OpenTelemetry instrumentation with traces and Qualitytrace for enhancing your e2e and integration tests with trace-based testing. The infrastructure will use Tempo as the trace data store, and OpenTelemetry Collector to receive traces from the Node.js app and send them to Tempo.
